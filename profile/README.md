## Outland Mod Series
The Outland series of RimWorld mods are aimed at adding a medieval and fantasy aspect to the game, in a highly modular set of mods rather than one ridiculously large overhaul so you can, for the most part, pick and choose what you want included just by selecting the modules you want. From simple additions to the tribal stage and medieval factions with their own visual flair and xenotypes, to steam based automation (soon) and arcane spellcasting (very soon), once this series is complete you'll have a highly flexible and configurable fantasy medieval experience.

### Does this remove/disable post-Medieval content?
No, currently there is no part of Outland that does this, I do have one planned for future once most of the modules are complete though, I just see no real reason to till there's at least an Outland alternative to basic vanilla functionality that would be considered that level of tech.

### Support
Like the mods and want to show some support? Anyone is welcome to do so via [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/neronix17), huge thanks to everyone who has supported me even a little, it's literally prevented me from starving, or running out of utilities more often than I'd like to admit. If you can't afford to don't worry, there's always going to be some free posts if you just follow (completely free) instead.

### Issues
You can submit a ticket on any of the mods if you have any issues. Make sure that:
- You are up to date ([cloning the repo using GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop) is the easiest way, you then just fetch the latest version when you want to update)
- If you are downloading the zip directly and using that make sure to DELETE old versions first! Overwriting isn't enough in the case where a file is removed/renamed and WILL cause problems!
- Provide steps to reproduce it, if I can't then it's much harder for me to even guess how to fix. If it's a random issue that doesn't appear to have steps, it probably does and is just hard to figure out, so try to include as much info as you can if you can't figure out exact steps.
- Include a HugsLib Log using Ctrl + F12 in-Game or clicking the Share button on the log window when it's open, if you can't upload the log, you can always copy to clipboard!

If you're not using HugsLib, then use it, this isn't a debate, you either use it or you do not get help as I CAN'T without it in most cases.

Ideally you can save us both a lot of time if you:
- Check you can reproduce the issue in a minimal list, this will hopefully rule out conflicts.
- If it IS a conflict, narrow down what mod it is happening with.

Odds are that if it's a conflict, only you will be able to find it, I do not have the time to test every mod in everyones mod list that has an issue to find it, and for all we know it could be an outdated version of that mod that's causing the problem and would be impossible for me to find. The best way to deal with this is a binary search, which is loading up with half your mods enabled, if it's still breaking then the conflict is still loaded, and you just repeat until you narrow it down, at most this should only take a handful of tries. It's best to use an external mod manager like RimPy or RimSort so you can save/load your original list easily.

### Got a fix yourself?
In the less than yearly occurrence that you have a fix you want to contribute you are absolutely welcome to do so with a pull request.
